h2. DonorMAtch

A simple scalali based script which uses the linkedin API and finds people
based on location. Then it queries the HEP database and shows which people
have companies that match donations.

h2. To run

You must have scala 2.9.1 installed.
Go to http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads

You probably also need Java6 installed, but it may already be on your machine.

Then do:

cd bin
