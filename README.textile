h2. DonorMatch

A simple scalali based script which uses the linkedin API and finds people
based on location. Then it queries the HEP database and shows which people
have companies that match donations.

It can be run on an input file with a simple format (run it and it'll tell you
what format it expects)

It will generate a simple report in HTML

h2. To run

You must have scala 2.9.1 installed.
